### We'll make you your very own folder!

Copy and paste my folder (Ben) in src and rename it to your first name. 

Inside is your component ( your-name.js ), which renders your log. Change the file and component name (down by the export as well!) to your first name. 

The log (inside log.js) is what you'll update daily - right now, it's just a simple array of JS objects that each have a date and array of tasks.

Clear the log except for one object - you can copy and paste it below the previous one every day and just change the contents.
